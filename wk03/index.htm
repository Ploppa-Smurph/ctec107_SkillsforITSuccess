    A personal code of ethics puts into writing the ideas and beliefs that are the
essence of a person’s life and which allow a person to say, “I will do this because
I believe that...” A code of ethics is a document that is a daily reminder of what
a person believes in and a source of encouragement in their daily life.
For this assignment, you will write a personal code of ethics for an IT (Information 
Technology) job. 
The assignment should not exceed 2 double-spaced pages (12-point Times New 
Roman or Arial) and should include the following elements:
1. An introductory paragraph describing your IT related job. (ex: Software Analyst, 
Networking Tech, Computer Repair Tech)
2. A detailed code of ethics addressing all (or at least most) of the major
ethical issues likely to be faced by someone in this position.(at least 3 ethics code)
3. An explanation of how someone in this job (in this case, you!!!) would
use your code of ethics.
