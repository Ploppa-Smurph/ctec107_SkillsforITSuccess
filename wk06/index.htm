    <br><br> notes on Kwame Christian's Talk business consultant and negotiation consultant - conflict management. kwame loves cinnamon toast crunch - his wife ate his cereal and so he ate her granola.
    <br>conflict can be intimidating and infuriating - society evolved faster than our brains and we have fight or flight reflex. amegdalya highjack - fight, flight, or freeze.
    <br>Kwame grew up in Tiffon Ohio -- it was an all white area and he looked and sounded different.
    <br>he became a people pleaser. his mentor later told him "there is a difference between being liked and being respected."
    <br><br>Conflict is an opportunity - you can repair valuable relationships or remove malignant relationships
    <br><b>Compassionate Curiosity</b> we need to listen more effectively. need to be able to realize we can be wrong, or that we might lose a relationship.
    <br>Slow down and ask High Level Questions - use your <b>PreFrontal Cortex</b> (center for logical thinking) 'listen i hear you are upset. what are your concerns, how can i help and make this better.'
    <br><br> in your personal life the relationship is closer and the stakes get higher
    <br>a lot of times issues that we have; other people do not realize how we feel -- 'the other side is blissfully unaware of the impact that their behavior has on us'
    <br><br>living in a time where people talk less - try using 'Compassionate Curiosity' to improve relationships.
